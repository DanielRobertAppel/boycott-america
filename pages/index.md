Climate Change is a serious threat.

By pulling out of the Paris Agreement, US President Donald Trump has endangered all our futures. 
Donald Trump is not alone: many US politicians hold similar views, or are content to ignore
the issue. We have to convince America to act.

Until the United States of America joins the international community in tackling climate change,
I pledge that:

[ ] I will not visit the USA.

[ ] I will buy American last: if there is an alternative non-US product or company available, I will choose them.

[ ] I will not invest in America.

[ ] I will make an exception for companies that are carbon-neutral.


List some American companies you will be boycotting: (e.g. Coca-Cola)

We will notify these companies. You can also write to them yourself, which is the most effective.

Note: We are not anti-American. We just need America to change: we all share the Earth's climate, 
it is not acceptable for America to wreck the environment. This boycott will end as soon as America
starts tackling climate change.
