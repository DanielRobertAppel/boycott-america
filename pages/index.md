Climate Change is a serious threat. For many people around the world it is already a life or death issue. 

In sub-Saharan Africa, climate change is triggering more extreme drought[1]. In Bangladesh, rising sea levels - brought on by melting ice and warming seas - are forcing people to abandon their homes [2]. In Britain, Europe, and the USA itself, the increase in floods and violent storms destroy people's homes, whilst heatwaves cause crop failure. Climate change is already killing an estimated 400,000 people a year.[3] These problems will get worse. The effects of carrying on polluting without change would be catastrophic for all of us.

The Paris Agreement is not perfect, but it is a major step forward. 
The EU, China, India -- in fact every other country except for Syria and Nicaragua -- have signed the Paris Agreement. 

By pulling America, the 2nd biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, out of the Paris Agreement, US President Donald Trump has endangered all our futures. Donald Trump is not alone in the US: many US politicians hold similar views, or are content to ignore the issue. We have to convince America to act. 

Please sign the pledge below to tell Donald Trump in a language he understands (money) that this matters.

Name: 

This will be public. You can give a nickname if you prefer.

Email:

We will not share your email address.


Until the United States of America joins the international community in tackling climate change,
I pledge that:

[ ] I will not visit the USA.

[ ] I will buy American last: if there is an alternative non-US product or company available, I will choose them.

[ ] I will not invest in America.

[ ] I will make an exception for American companies that are carbon-neutral.


List some American companies you will be boycotting: (e.g. Exxon)

We will notify these companies. You can also write to them yourself, which is the most effective.

Note: We are not anti-American -- we just need America to change! We all share the Earth's climate, 
it is not acceptable for America to wreck the environment. This boycott will end as soon as America
starts tackling climate change.
